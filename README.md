# Java-Internship
For my java internship at Upskill Campus
There are 3 files which I will be pushing into this repository as of now for my music player project. The 3 java source files belong to the same package and the main class is from where the execution starts, thereafter using the functionalities from the song class and controller class. I have used javafx package classes for the UI and main functions.
Apart from the above 3 files, I have added another 3 source code files, a total of 6 files, which are my backend structures for song play, folder and playlist functionality. The backend source codes are to be integrated with my previous 3 files for both UI and backend functionality to my buttons and other functions, making the project fully functional.
